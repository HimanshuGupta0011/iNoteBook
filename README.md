iNoteBook is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It enables users to securely manage and organize their personal notes, featuring a robust authentication system with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user login and registration. Users can create, read, update, and delete notes, with their data securely stored in the database.

This project was built as part of my learning experience while following CodeWithHarry's ReactJS course on YouTube. It serves as a practical demonstration of full-stack development, focusing on user authentication, authorization, and CRUD operations in a real-world application.
